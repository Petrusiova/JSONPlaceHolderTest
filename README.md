I've created 4 scenarios to test API connected to user and 4 - to posts.

I used Java, Rest Assured, Junit5, Allure, Gradle, Lombok plugin

After running a test/group of tests you can generate report (automatically).

Run AllureServe to look through the results with alternative instrument (screenshot below)
